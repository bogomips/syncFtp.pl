command line tool to manage vsftpd users stored in a mysql db

I wrote an article on how to get a vsftpd server working with chrooted users stored in a mysql table.
Currently it is written in Italian, but the steps you need are pretty clear, I will translate it in english as soon as I get a bit of free time.
